# PRAY: Prayers, Rituals, And You

Morrowind is all about religion - with PRAY, your character can practice these religions!

## Features

- Pray once a day for a long lasting blessing
- Learn prayers by joining different religious factions
- Advance your theology skills by praying, which will unlock higher level prayers
- Perform rituals which require and consume a set of items relevant to the ritual
- Do freaky Sixth House rituals to chow down on that delicious corprusmeat
- Learn miscellaneous prayers and rituals from characters and books

PRAY adds Tribunal, Divine, Ashlander, and Sixth House Prayers into the game utilising merlord's skill and crafting frameworks and MWSE to fully integrate it into the vanilla UI. Your new skills (Tribunal, Divine, Ashlander, and Sixth House Theology) can be found in your stats menu under 'Other  Skills'. You are able to pray once a day, and praying will level up the corresponding skill, unlocking new prayers and rituals over time.

Use the `P` key to access the PRAY menu. Prayers lock your character into meditation, show a quote from an in-game text, and produce a set of magic effects. Rituals are more involved prayers that consume materials.
